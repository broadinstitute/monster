# NEW BROADIES START HERE

**DO THESE STEPS BEFORE GOING HOME AFTER ORIENTATION**

## Link GitHub
Permissions in DSP are driven by a combination of GitHub teams and Google groups.
The two are synchronized (to some extent) by nightly jobs run by BITS. Step one for
any new hire should be to link identities in those two systems.

1. Decide if you want to use an existing GitHub account for work, or
   [create a new one](https://github.com/join?source=header-home). We don't have a
   strong preference either way, **but** if you decide to use an existing account
   make sure to add your Broad email to it.
2. [Set up 2-Factor Authentication](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication)
   on the account you choose to use. This is required by BITS' account-linking job.
3. Go to [BITS' people app](https://people.broadinstitute.org) and sign in with your
   Broad Google account.
4. On the "My Profile" page, link your profile to GitHub under the "Other Profiles" header.
   You will need to approve the OpenID scopes for the link to go through.
5. Linking accounts should bring you to [this page](https://broad-github.appspot.com/).
   Follow the listed steps to:
   1. Set up 2FA on your Google account (if you haven't already)
   2. Link or relink your GitHub account to your Google account (if needed)
   Once the accounts are properly linked, you should receive an email invite to join
   the `broadinstitute` GitHub organization. Accept the invitation.

## Request Group Access
Request access to these Google Groups via email. These Groups are used to manage recurring
meeting invites and GitHub team membership, so the sooner you can be added, the better.

## Set up Slack
We prefer Slack over email for most communication.

1. Visit Broad's [Slack portal](https://broadinstitute.slack.com/), and log in with
   your Broad Google account.
2. Download the [Slack desktop app](https://slack.com/downloads) and log in.
3. Join the `#monster` channel to get started.
